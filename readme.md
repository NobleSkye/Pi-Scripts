# Read Me

## About
this is a repository for scripts that I use for my personal raspberry pi projects, each folder contains scripts for that specific PI, 
Some scripts will work on multiple PIs, but some are specific to a single PI. if its noted in the folder name that it is a specific PI, then it will work on that PI, but not 100% guaranteed to work on other PIs. should be a readme for each thing if i remember to put one in there.
